# WordNote

In the course of learning the C# language and the WinForms API, I implemented the Wordpad application from Windows with all the basic functions. 
Unlike the previously developed Notepad, this application supports formatting and printing text, including fonts, bold and oblique, colors, 
centering, etc., but does not have features such as spell checking, pagination management and table creation.
